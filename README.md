# dynamic-scope

A library that changes the binding properties of closure variables, mimicing dynamic scoping rules.

```python
>>> from dynamic_scope import dynamic, inject
>>> def make_functions():
...     # value has to be defined locally in a parent scope
...     # otherwise the generated bytecode in the functions will treat it
...     # as a global
...     value = 0
...     def normal():
...         return value
...     @dynamic
...     def dyn():
...         return value
...     return normal, dyn
... 
>>> value = 1
>>> normal, dyn = make_functions()
>>> assert normal() == 0
>>> assert dyn() == 1
>>> value = 2
>>> assert normal() == 0
>>> assert dyn() == 2
```
